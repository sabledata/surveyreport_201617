# Results and Discussion

## FISHING
### `r yr` Survey

```{r HistoricText, echo=FALSE}

history <-""

```

The `r yr` survey was x days long and divided into three legs of x, x and x days for a total of x fishing days. 

Of the x original blocks for the StRS portion of the survey, x were replaced at-sea; x block was rejected after on-ground inspection and x were rejected as they did not meet the depth strata requirements.

### `r yr+1` Survey 

The `r yr+1` survey was x days long and divided into three legs of x, x and x days for a total of x fishing days.  

Of the x original blocks for the StRS portion of the survey, x were replaced at sea; x was rejected after on-ground inspection, x were rejected due to unfishable habitat, and x were rejected as they did not meet the depth strata requirements.

## CATCH PER UNIT EFFORT (CPUE) 

The sablefish surveys of `r yr` and `r yr+1` have documented recent changes in the sablefish population structure.

### Stratified Random Set CPUE

Catch per unit effort (CPUE), as indexed by kilograms of sablefish per trap, increased across most offshore survey strata in 2018, and again in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure5)). The most pronounced increases occured in the middle depth strata which recorded the largest CPUEs in 2018 and 2019 since the StRS began (Figure \@ref(fig:figure6)). These increases in CPUE were the result of a relatively large increase in the number of small sablefish encountered on the survey (Figure \@ref(fig:figure7) and Figure \@ref(fig:figure8)), likely due to a large recent recruitment event that has occurred coastwide [@DFO2020].  The stratified mean survey abundance in `r yr+1` was `r round (strat_mean$yStr[strat_mean$SET_YEAR==current_year],digits=0)` kg/trap, which is up `r per_change_current`% from `r current_year-1` and `r per_change_avg`% from the `r yr-1`-`r yr` average (Figure \@ref(fig:figure9)).

### Mainland Inlet CPUE

CPUE in the mainlaind inlets has varied in a relatively predictable manner over time with peak CPUE occuring every 5-8 years (Figure \@ref(fig:figure10)). In the early part of the time series (mid-1990s) average CPUE remained relatively constant before a peak in CPUE was observed in 1999, followed by declines to consistent levels until another peak in 2003 and 2004, and again in 2011.  In `r yr`, CPUE returned (~`r data18.mn` fish, and ~`r data18kg.mn` kg per trap) to the levels observed during previous peaks. In `r yr+1`, the highest catch rates of the 26 year time series were observed (~`r data19.mn` fish, and ~`r data19kg.mn` kg per trap).  Notably, the `r yr`-`r yr+1` mean weight (~`r data19kg` kg) declined to an all time low due to large number of small fish becoming available to the survey.

## CATCH COMPOSITION

### 2018 Survey

A total of `r totalS[1]` taxonomic groups were represented in the catches in StRS sets in `r yr[1]` (Table \@ref(tab:table3)).  These included `r roundfishS[1]` roundfish species, `r rockfishS[1]` rockfish species, `r flatfishS[1]`  flatfish species and `r invertS[1]` invertebrate species. Other than sablefish, the most common species, by weight,  were  `r topStRSsp1[1]` (*`r topStRSsc1`*), `r topStRSsp2` (*`r topStRSsc2`*), `r topStRSsp3` (*`r topStRSsc3`*),   `r topStRSsp4` (*`r topStRSsc4`*) and  `r topStRSsp5` (*`r topStRSsc5`*).   

A total of `r totalI` taxonomic groups were represented in the catches from traditional standardized sets conducted in mainland inlet localities in `r yr[1]` (Table \@ref(tab:table4)).  These included `r roundfishI` roundfish species, `r rockfishI`  rockfish species, `r flatfishI` flatfish species and `r invertI` invertebrate species.  The most common species captured, in order of total weights, other than sablefish were `r topInletsp1` (*`r topInletsc1`*) and  `r topInletsp2` (*`r topInletsc2`*).

### 2019 Survey

A total of `r totalS.2[1]` taxonomic groups were represented in StRS sets in `r yr+1` (Table \@ref(tab:table5)).  These included `r roundfishS.2[1]` roundfish species, `r rockfishS.2[1]` rockfish species, `r flatfishS.2[1]`  flatfish species and `r invertS.2[1]` invertebrate species. Other than sablefish, the most common species, by weight, were  `r topStRSsp1.2[1]` (*`r topStRSsc1.2`*), `r topStRSsp2.2` (*`r topStRSsc2.2`*), `r topStRSsp3.2` (*`r topStRSsc3.2`*),   `r topStRSsp4.2` (*`r topStRSsc4.2`*) and  `r topStRSsp5.2` (*`r topStRSsc5.2`*).   

A total of `r totalI.2` taxonomic groups were represented in the catches from traditional standardized sets conducted in mainland inlet localities in `r yr+1` (Table \@ref(tab:table6)).  These included `r roundfishI.2` roundfish species, `r rockfishI.2`  rockfish species, `r flatfishI.2` flatfish species and `r invertI.2` invertebrate species.  The most common species, by weight, other than sablefish were `r topInletsp1.2` (*`r topInletsc1.2`*) and `r topInletsp2.2` (*`r topInletsc2.2`*).

## SABLEFISH SAMPLING

A detailed breakdown of the fate of the catch in each trap for the `r yr` and `r yr+1` survey is listed in Appendix \@ref(app:fifth-appendix) and Appendix \@ref(app:sixth-appendix), respectively. 

During the `r yr` StRS, a total of `r format(countStRS[2,2], big.mark=",")` sablefish were caught.   Of that total, `r format(countStRS[2,5], big.mark=",")` were tagged and released and `r format(countStRS[2,7], big.mark=",")` were retained for biological sampling. Of the tagged fish, `r countStRS[2,3]` were previously tagged fish that were re-released with a new tag.  Another `r countStRS[2,4]` previously tagged fish were retained for sampling (Appendix \@ref(app:seventh-appendix)).

Out of the `r format(countStRS[1,2], big.mark=",")` sablefish captured during the `r yr` traditional survey (inlet standardized sets), `r format(countStRS[1,5], big.mark=",")` were tagged and released, `r format(countStRS[1,7], big.mark=",")` were used for biological sampling and `r format(countStRS[1,3], big.mark=",")` were previously tagged fish re-released with a new tag (Appendix \@ref(app:seventh-appendix)). 

Overall, the StRS sets had a higher proportion of females than males over the spatial strata `r stratafemale` with the exception of S~5 where the sex ratio was equal (Table \@ref(tab:table7)).  More females than males were seen in the shallow depth stratum within the spatial strata `r shallsfemale`.  In the mid depth stratum, there were more males than females in `r midsmale`.  The deepest depth stratum saw more females in spatial strata `r deepsfemale`.  More females than males were sampled in `r inletw` traditional mainland inlet localities and samples ranged from `r femaleRange[1]` to `r femaleRange[2]` percent females (Table \@ref(tab:table7)).  

During the `r yr+1` StRS, a total of `r format(countStRS2[2,2], big.mark=",")` sablefish were caught.   Of that total, `r format(countStRS2[2,5], big.mark=",")` were tagged and released and `r format(countStRS2[2,7], big.mark=",")` were retained for biological sampling. Of the tagged fish, `r format(countStRS2[2,3], big.mark=",")` were previously tagged fish that were re-released with a new tag. Another `r format(countStRS2[2,4], big.mark=",")` previously tagged fish were retained for sampling (Appendix \@ref(app:eighth-appendix)).

Out of the `r format(countStRS2[1,2], big.mark=",")` sablefish captured during the `r yr+1` traditional survey (inlet standardized sets), `r format(countStRS2[1,5], big.mark=",")` were tagged and released, `r format(countStRS2[1,7], big.mark=",")` were used for biological sampling and `r format(countStRS2[1,3], big.mark=",")` were previously tagged fish re-released with a new tag (Appendix \@ref(app:eighth-appendix)). 

Overall, the StRS design sets had a higher proportion of females to males over the spatial strata `r stratafemale.2` (Table \@ref(tab:table8)).  The sex ratio was females biased in the shallow depth stratum within the spatial strata `r shallsfemale.2`.  In the mid depth stratum, there were more males than females in `r midsmale.2`.  The deepest depth stratum saw more females in spatial strata `r deepsfemale.2`.  More females than males were sampled in `r inletw.2` traditional mainland inlet localities and samples ranged from `r femaleRange.2[1]` to `r femaleRange.2[2]` percent females (Table \@ref(tab:table8)).  

Significant differences in length distributions between female and male sablefish are exhibited in the data collected from the StRS portion of the 2003 - 2019 surveys. The mean fork length ($\bar{x}$) for females was `r mLf2` cm and the mean fork length ($\bar{x}$) for males was `r mLm2` cm (Figure \@ref(fig:figure11)a). 

In `r yr`, the average mean fork length for the `r format(length(firstyrfem$sex), big.mark=",")` females was `r round(favgyr1$AvL,1)` cm  and the average mean fork length for the `r format(length(firstyrmal$sex), big.mark=",")` males was `r round(mavgyr1$AvL,1) ` cm. In `r yr+1`, the average mean fork length for the `r format(length(secondyrfem$sex), big.mark=",")` females was `r round(favgyr2$AvL,1)` cm and the average mean fork length for the `r format(length(secondyrmal$sex), big.mark=",")` males was `r round(mavgyr2$AvL,1)` cm.   The mean length of both females and males reached their lowest mean size since 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure11)b). 

On average, female sablefish grow faster and reach far greater size (Figure \@ref(fig:figure12)a,b) compared to males (Figure \@ref(fig:figure12)c,d).


## SABLEFISH SUB-LEGAL ENCOUNTERS

There have been distinct distribution patterns across strata of sub-legal sablefish (<55 cm fork length), following the highly anomalous warm ocean conditions of the “The Blob” [@Bond2015].   More than half of the sub-legal specimens were captured in the southern strata (S~1~) mid-depth waters (RD~2~) in 2014 and shallow waters (RD~1~) in 2015. The sub-legal specimen count was above 50% in both 2017 and 2018 in the northern strata of S~4~ and S~5~  mid-depth waters (RD~2~). In 2019, the sub-legal specimens dominated in all StRS survey strata (S~1~ to S~5~) mid-depth waters (RD~2~) (Figure \@ref(fig:figure13)). 

## OTHER FISH SAMPLING

Length, sex, maturity, otoliths and DNA samples were collected for the rougheye/blackspotted rockfish complex.  Length, sex, maturity and otoliths were collected for shortraker rockfish.  In addition, length, sex, maturity, otoliths and DNA were collected for yelloweye rockfish.  For Pacific halibut and Pacific sleeper sharks, only length samples were collected (Appendix \@ref(app:nineth-appendix) and Appendix \@ref(app:tenth-appendix)).

## RECOVERED TAGGED SABLEFISH

During the `r yr` and `r yr+1` sablefish surveys, `r countStRS[2,3] + countStRS[1,3]` and `r countStRS2[2,3] + countStRS2[1,3]` previously tagged fish were re-released live with a new tag, respectively.  DFO has been tagging, releasing and recovering sablefish since 1991.  The highest recovery rate is within the first year of release (Table \@ref(tab:table9)).

## SABLEFISH AGES

The highest proportion of male ages in StRS sets for 2003 through to 2011 were 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8, 10 and 12 years of age, respectively.  Another cohort appeared in 2012 through to 2016 as 4, 5, 7, 7 and 8 year olds.  A cohort appeared in 2017 which was dominated by 3 year olds (Figure \@ref(fig:figure14)a).

The highest proportion of female ages in the StRS sets for 2003 through to 2010 were 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years of age, respectively. Then, another cohort appeared in 2011 through to 2015, showing up as 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 year olds.  In 2016 and 2017 the highest proportion of female sablefish were ages 3 and 4 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure14)b).

Historic data from all samples lists the oldest female sablefish at `r oldest.female` years of age collected in `r yr.oldest.female` where as the oldest male sablefish with the age of `r oldest.male` years old was documented for the year `r yr.oldest.male`.

## OCEANOGRAPHIC TEMPERATURES AND DEPTHS
Co-plots of average temperatures and average depths by 1-degree latitude intervals from south-west Vancouver Island to northwest Haida Gwaii exhibit a general trend of decreasing temperature with depth for `r yr` and `r yr+1` (Figure \@ref(fig:figure15)).  

SBE 39 recorders have been placed on survey fishing sets since 2006. In the shallow waters, the lowest average temperature was `r round(shallow.avg.min,1)` $^\circ$C (`r shallow.avg.min.yr`) within the `r shallow.avg.min.band1`$^\circ$ - `r shallow.avg.min.band2`$^\circ$ latitude band.  The highest average temperature was `r round(shallow.avg.max,1)` $^\circ$C (`r shallow.avg.max.yr`) in the southern `r shallow.avg.max.band1`$^\circ$ - `r shallow.avg.max.band2`$^\circ$ latitude band. Moving into the mid-depth waters, from 458-823 meters, the lowest average temperature was `r round(mid.avg.min,1)` $^\circ$C (`r mid.avg.min`) within the `r mid.avg.min.band1`$^\circ$ -`r mid.avg.min.band2` $^\circ$ latitude band.  The highest average temperature was `r round(mid.avg.max,1)` $^\circ$C (`r mid.avg.max.yr`) in the southern `r mid.avg.max.band1`$^\circ$ - `r mid.avg.max.band2`$^\circ$ latitude band.  In the deepest waters, the lowest average temperature of `r round(deep.avg.min,1)` $^\circ$C  (`r deep.avg.min.yr`) was found in the `r deep.avg.min.band1`$^\circ$ - `r deep.avg.min.band2`$^\circ$ latitude band and the highest average temperature was `r round(deep.avg.max,1)`$^\circ$C (`r deep.avg.max.yr`) in the southern `r deep.avg.max.band1`$^\circ$ -`r deep.avg.max.band2`$^\circ$ latitude band (Figure \@ref(fig:figure16)).

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The stock assessment survey and data report is the result of the collaborative efforts of many individuals.  Wild Canadian Sablefish has provided coordination and support of the annual sablefish survey since 1994.  The scientific staff that conducted the `r yr` sablefish research charter included `r credits[1,4]` of Archipelago Marine Research Ltd (AMR); and `r credits[2,4]` of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada. The scientific staff that conducted the `r yr+1` sablefish research charter included `r credits2[1,4]` of AMR; and `r credits2[2,4]` of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada.

A special thanks to the skipper and crew of the F/V `r boat`, whose efforts made the `r yr[1]` survey successful. In `r yr[1]`, the crew consisted of `r credits[3,4]`. Also, much appreciation  to the skipper and crew of the F/V `r boat2`, whose efforts made the `r yr+1` survey successful. In `r yr+1`, the crew consisted of `r credits2[3,4]`.
